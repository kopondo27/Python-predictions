#Making future predictions using python.

###Project Overview.
Turtle games is a gaming manufacturer and retailer that is keen to improve their overall sales performance. With the data provided, they would like to know:
- How their customers engage with and accumulate loyalty points.
- How the customers can be segmented into groups and how those groups can be targeted by the marketing department.
- How text data such as customer reviews can  be used to  inform marketing campaigns and make improvements to the business.
- How descriptive statistics can be used to provide insights into the suitability of the loyalty points data to create predictive models (e.g. normal distribution, skewness, or kurtosis) to justify the answer.

### Data Source.
  The company provide two datasets:
  - turtle_reviews.csv – Details on customer gender, age, remuneration, spending score, loyalty points, education, language, platform, review and summary across products.
  -  metadata_turtle_games.txt – Details of the data set, data quality, and reference.

    ###Tools used.
  - Python.

 ### Data cleaning and preparation.

    1. Load the needed file onto the notebook
    2. Sense-check the data in the file
    3. handle missing values.
    4. get more information of the file and a ssummary of the statistics.
    5. Remove unnecessary files and rename others
    
### Data exploration and analysis. (please see the uploaded jupiter notebook for the code)>
- Performed multiple regression to find out corelations between diffeerent varriables.
- Used decision trees to investigate how different factors contributed to acucumulation of loyalty points.
- Clustering to identify potential target groups in the data.
- Sentiment analysis to identify emotion in customer reviews.
- Leveraged different types of graphs and plots to ccreate a visual story.

#### Results.
1. Varied factors influenced accumulation of loyalty points differently.
2. The pay of the customers was positively corelated with high loyalty points
3. Spending scores increased as loyalty points increased.
4. The other factors had little to no correlation with accumulation of loyalty points.
5. The customer reviews were mixed but there was more positive than negative reviews.
6. The customer base consisted of low earning, high earning, low spending and high spending customers and these customer clusters determined how much the customers spent.
### Insights and recommendations.
   Analysed the results to provide insights to stakeholders.
   1. High paying customers be encouraged to spend more through offering them more 
loyalty points, membership prices and brand deals.
2. Customers with low pay be offered discounts and brand deals to help them save 
money as they spend.
3. Low spending customers be enticed with discounts, brand deals and membership 
prices.
